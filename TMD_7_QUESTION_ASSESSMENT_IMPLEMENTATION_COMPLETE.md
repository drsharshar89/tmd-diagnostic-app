    }
  }
}
```

### 🎯 Branching Logic

- **Q1 → Q2**: If pain reported, ask about movement-related pain
- **Q1 → Q3**: If no pain, skip to joint sounds
- **Q2 → Q3**: Continue to joint sounds assessment
- **Q3-Q7**: Sequential assessment of remaining symptoms
- **All → Result**: Complete assessment leads to results page
