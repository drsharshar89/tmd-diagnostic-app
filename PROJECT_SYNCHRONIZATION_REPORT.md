# 🏥 TMD Diagnostic App - Complete Project Synchronization Report

**Generated:** `${new Date().toISOString()}`  
**Status:** ✅ CRITICAL ISSUES RESOLVED - Ready for Development

---

## 📊 Executive Summary

Your TMD diagnostic application is a comprehensive medical-grade system implementing DC/TMD protocols with advanced diagnostic capabilities. The project follows Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) architecture with Domain-Driven Design (DDD) patterns.

### 🎯 Project Scope
- **Medical Standard:** DC/TMD Protocol v2.1 compliant
- **Architecture:** Feature-Sliced Design + Domain-Driven Design
- **Tech Stack:** React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Three.js
- **Assessment Types:** Quick (7-question) & Comprehensive (26-question)
- **Security:** HIPAA-compliant with encryption and audit trails

---

## ✅ Issues Resolved

### 1. Type Definition Conflicts ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** `QuickAssessmentAnswers` had conflicting definitions
- ❌ `/src/shared/types/index.ts`: Used simple `description: string`
- ✅ **Fixed:** Now uses standardized `q1-q7: boolean | null` format

### 2. Import Path Standardization ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Inconsistent import paths across features
- ❌ Mixed usage of `@/types` vs `@/shared/types`
- ✅ **Fixed:** All imports now use `@/shared/types`

### 3. Medical Protocol Compliance ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Pain scales mixing 0-10 with DC/TMD standard 0-4
- ❌ Some components used 0-10 pain scale
- ✅ **Fixed:** All pain assessments now use DC/TMD standard 0-4 scale

### 4. Barrel Export Organization ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Missing and duplicate exports
- ❌ Circular dependencies and duplicate exports
- ✅ **Fixed:** Clean barrel exports for all modules
